iTARGET: Interpretable Tailored Age Regression for Grouped Epigenetic Traits.



All experiments were conducted using Python 3.9, with FAISS-CPU 1.8.0 for similarity search, Scikit-learn 1.5.0 for machine learning algorithms and biolearn 0.4.3 for traditional pretrained epigenetic clocks, and custom scripts for preprocessing and feature selection. All code is available on Github\footnote{https://github.com/WuzipengYL/iTARGET-Interpretable-Tailored-Age-Regression-for-Grouped-Epigenetic-Traits.}. The computations were performed on Intel I7 14700k processors and 32 GB RAM. To ensure the robustness of the results, we performed five cross-validations on the entire dataset.
